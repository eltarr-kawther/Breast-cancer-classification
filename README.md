# Breast Cancer Classification
## Supervised learning 
Academic project about classification using CNN.   
The main goal is to estimate if the patient has forms of cancer or not, with such context we consider it necessary to minimize false negative prediction to ensure the model is rarely wrong when it estimate there is no traces of cancer.  
We use existing labeled data to train a Convolutional Neural Network.
